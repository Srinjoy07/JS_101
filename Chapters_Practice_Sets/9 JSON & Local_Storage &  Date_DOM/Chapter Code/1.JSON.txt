The difference between JS and JSON key-value pait is ...here both KEY and VALUE both are inside COLON 

JSON object:
{
    "firstName" : "Sam",
    "lastName" : "Smith",
}  //JavaScript Object Notation

//Why we need JSON
JSON is used to send data between a server and a web application. It is a lightweight data interchange
Strings are easy to transport over network. 
Common in network calls and data storage.

JSON is data format,JS is a data structure.

//USE case:
JSON.parse()--> converts JS to JSON
JSON.stringify()--> converts JSON to JS
